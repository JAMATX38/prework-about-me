      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a proud Father of Isabella Martinez! She truly is the light of my life! I have learned so much from her and I continue to learn from her. I have decided to make a career change because my industry is changeing so much and becoming more and more digital. An opportunity presented it self and I had to jump on it! I am excited to take a jump into the unknown and learn another life long skill!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I like to say that I am a TEXAS BOY BORN AND RAISED!!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Staying home watching 90 Day Fiance with my wife and 5 doggies!!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be to work with the Military in some way or another.. maybe this is my chance to explore that !!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Austin, TX- South of the river! If your from Austin you will understand what I mean.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a Web Developer because this is the NEW language of the future, everything is going digital and not being a part of this change can be damaging. Ive been a Butcher for 20 years so finding another carrer that doesnt take such a toll on my body is also another plus in my book!.</p>
